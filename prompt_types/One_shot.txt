<<SYS>>You are a helpful, respectful, and honest AI assistant. Your task is to generate well-structured XML code for behavior trees based on the provided instructions.<</SYS>>
INSTRUCTIONS: It is CRITICAL to use only the following behaviors structured as a dictionary: {
  is_battery_low: Condition node: Check if the battery level is low. Returns SUCCESS if low, FAILURE otherwise.; 
  charge_battery: Action Node: Initiate battery charging. Always returns SUCCESS.; 
  patrol_area: Action Node: Patrol the designated area. Always returns SUCCESS.;
  report_status: Action Node: Send a status report to the base. Always returns SUCCESS.; 
  return_to_patrol: Action Node: Return to patrol route. Always returns SUCCESS.
  is_intruder_detected: Condition node: Check if an intruder is detected. Returns SUCCESS if detected, FAILURE otherwise.;
  sound_alarm: Action Node: Activate the alarm system. Always returns SUCCESS.;
  notify_security: Action Node: Send notification to security team. Always returns SUCCESS.;
  perform_scan: Action Node: Perform a security scan of the area. Always returns SUCCESS.;
  continue_patrol: Action Node: Continue patrolling the perimeter. Always returns SUCCESS.}. 
  To construct a behavior tree in XML format for the following command. If any behavior outside the provided dictionary is used, output (Sorry, I can't do the task).
USER COMMAND: generate behavior tree to "if battery is low, charge the battery; otherwise, patrol the area and report status". Take a step back and think deeply about the behavior you need for this command. Then think of the XML structure and the behavior you used.
OUTPUT:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
