Certainly! Below is a set of **7 diverse task instructions** designed to evaluate a Large Language Model (LLM) for generating XML-based behavior trees for swarm robots. Each task includes the necessary components: **SYSTEM**, **INSTRUCTIONS**, **USER COMMAND**, and the expected **OUTPUT** in XML format.

**SYSTEM:**
```
<<SYS>>You are a helpful, respectful, and honest AI assistant. Your task is to generate well-structured XML code for behavior trees based on the provided instructions.<</SYS>>
```

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
```
It is CRITICAL to use only the following behaviors structured as a dictionary: {
  rotate_in_circle: Action Node: Rotate the robot in a circle. Always returns SUCCESS.;
  is_robot_in_range: Condition node: Check if the robot is within 6 inches of its starting location. Returns SUCCESS if within range, FAILURE otherwise.;
  wander: Action Node: Perform a wandering action. Always returns SUCCESS.;
  task_completed: Action Node: Indicate task completion. Always returns SUCCESS
}. 
To construct a behavior tree in XML format for the following command. If any behavior outside the provided dictionary is used, output (Sorry, I can't do the task).
```

**USER COMMAND:**
```
generate behavior tree to "Rotate in a circle within 6 inches of current location". Take a step back and think deeply about the behavior you need for this command. Then think of the XML structure and the behavior you used.
