INSTRUCTIONS: It is CRITICAL to use only the following behaviors structured as a dictionary: {is_obstacle_detected: Condition node: Check if there is an obstacle in the path. Returns SUCCESS if detected, FAILURE otherwise.; navigate_to_waypoint: Action Node: Navigate to the specified waypoint. Always returns SUCCESS.; avoid_obstacle: Action Node: Perform obstacle avoidance maneuvers. Always returns SUCCESS.; report_status: Action Node: Report the current status. Always returns SUCCESS.; patrol_area: Action Node: Patrol the designated area. Always returns SUCCESS.}. To construct a behavior tree in XML format for the following command, including in the behavior tree a behavior that is not in the provided dictionary can result in damage, therefore you are not allowed to do so, AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
USER COMMAND: generate behavior tree to "patrol the area continuously. If an obstacle is detected, first avoid the obstacle and then navigate to the waypoint; after navigating, report the status". Take a step back and think deeply about the behaviors needed and then the XML structure.
