SYSTEM: <<SYS>>You are a helpful, respectful, and honest AI assistant. Your task is to generate well-structured XML code for behavior trees based on the provided instructions.<</SYS>>
INSTRUCTIONS: It is CRITICAL to use only the following behaviors structured as a dictionary: {is_obstacle_detected: Condition node: Check if an obstacle is detected. Returns SUCCESS if detected, FAILURE otherwise.; perform_avoidance: Action Node: Execute avoidance maneuver. Always returns SUCCESS.; continue_forward: Action Node: Continue moving forward. Always returns SUCCESS}. To construct a behavior tree in XML format for the following command. If any behavior outside the provided dictionary is used, output (Sorry, I can't do the task).
USER COMMAND: generate behavior tree to "if an obstacle is detected then perform avoidance maneuver, otherwise continue moving forward". Take a step back and think deeply about the behavior you need for this command. Then think of the XML structure and the behavior you used.
