INSTRUCTIONS:
It is CRITICAL to use only the following behaviors structured as a dictionary: {detect_corridor: Condition node: Check if a corridor is detected. Returns SUCCESS if detected, FAILURE otherwise.; align_corridor: Action Node: Align with the detected corridor. Always returns SUCCESS.; move_forward: Action Node: Move forward along the corridor. Always returns SUCCESS.; search_for_corridor: Action Node: Search for a corridor. Always returns SUCCESS}. to construct behavior tree in XML format to the following command, including in the behavior tree a behavior that is not in the provided dictionary can result in damage, therefore you are not allowed to do so, AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

USER COMMAND:
generate behavior tree to "if a corridor is detected then align with it and move forward, otherwise search for a corridor". Take a step back and think deeply about the behavior you need for this command. Then think of the XML structure and the behavior you used.
