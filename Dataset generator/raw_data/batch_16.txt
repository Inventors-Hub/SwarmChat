INSTRUCTIONS:  
It is CRITICAL to use only the following behaviors structured as a dictionary:

is_item_available: Condition node: Check if a specific item is available in inventory. Returns SUCCESS if available, FAILURE otherwise.
collect_item: Action Node: Collect the specified item. Always returns SUCCESS.
check_inventory: Condition node: Check the current inventory status. Returns SUCCESS if inventory is not full, FAILURE if full.
deposit_item: Action Node: Deposit an item to storage. Always returns SUCCESS.

To construct a behavior tree in XML format for the following command, including in the behavior tree a behavior that is not in the provided dictionary can result in damage, therefore you are not allowed to do so, AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

USER COMMAND:  
Generate behavior tree to "continuously check inventory; if inventory is not full, and item is available, collect the item; if inventory is full, deposit an item". Take a step back and think deeply about the behavior.
