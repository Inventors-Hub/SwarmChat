     INSTRUCTIONS: It is CRITICAL to use only the following behaviors structured as a dictionary: say: Action Node: Speak the provided message using text-to-speech if it hasn't been spoken before. Args: message (str): The message to be spoken. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed.
flocking: Action Node: Adjust the agent's move vector by blending alignment and separation forces from nearby agents. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed.
align_with_swarm: Action Node: Align the agent's move vector with the average movement of nearby agents. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed.

is_target_reached: Condition node: Check if the agent has reached the target. Returns: SUCCESS if the target is within 15 units of distance, FAILURE otherwise.
change_color: Action Node: Change the agent's color to 'white', 'green', or 'red'. Args: color (str): Color name. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed.
is_agent_in_nest: Condition node: Determine if the agent is in the nest. Returns: SUCCESS if the agent is in the nest, FAILURE otherwise.
agent_movement_freeze: Action node: Freeze the agent's movement, typically to indicate a stop in activity. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed.
continue_movement_agent: Action node: Continue the agent's movement after it has been previously frozen. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed.
move_randomly: Action node: Perform a wandering action where the agent moves randomly within the environment. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed.
is_path_clear: Condition node: Check if the path ahead of the agent is clear of obstacles. Returns: SUCCESS if no obstacles are detected ahead, FAILURE if obstacles are present.
is_line_formed: Condition node: Determine if the agent has formed a line with a reference point at the center of the window. Returns: SUCCESS if the line is formed with the center, FAILURE otherwise.
form_line: Action node: Direct the agent to form a line towards the center of the window. This function adjuststhe agent's position to align it with the center. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed.

    The output MUST follow this XML structure and the behaviors you use must be from the provided dictionary. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
    USER COMMAND: generate behavior tree to ""detect an obstacle, avoid it, and then flock safely with other agents"".

    Take a step back and think deeply about the behavior you need for this command.

    Consider the XML structure and the behaviors you use.

    The output MUST follow this XML structure exactly, including:
    - A root element with BTCPP_format and main_tree_to_execute attributes.
    - A <BehaviorTree> element with an inner structure of Sequences, Fallback, Conditions, and Actions.
    - A <TreeNodesModel> section listing all node models.

    No additional text or commentary outside the XML.

    Output only the XML behavior tree without extra text.

move_randomly: Action node: Perform a wandering action where the agent moves randomly within the environment. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed.
is_path_clear: Condition node: Check if the path ahead of the agent is clear of obstacles. Returns: SUCCESS if no obstacles are detected ahead, FAILURE if obstacles are present.
is_line_formed: Condition node: Determine if the agent has formed a line with a reference point at the center of the window. Returns: SUCCESS if the line is formed with the center, FAILURE otherwise.
form_line: Action node: Direct the agent to form a line towards the center of the window. This function adjuststhe agent's position to align it with the center. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed.

    USER COMMAND: generate behavior tree to ""check if path is clear, form a line at the center"".

    Take a step back and think deeply about the behavior you need for this command. Consider the XML structure and the behaviors you use.
    The output MUST follow this XML structure exactly, including:
    - A root element with BTCPP_format and main_tree_to_execute attributes.
    - A <BehaviorTree> element with an inner structure of Sequences, Fallback, Conditions, and Actions.
    - A <TreeNodesModel> section listing all node models.
    - No additional text or commentary outside the XML.
    Output only the XML behavior tree without extra text.

flocking: Action Node: Adjust the agent's move vector by blending alignment and separation forces from nearby agents. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed.
