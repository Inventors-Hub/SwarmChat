      </BTCPP_format>

    Note: The example above is incorrect because the 'approach_target' action isn't in the provided dictionary. So, you must use only the allowed actions and conditions.
    So, let's think about how to structure this correctly.

    First, the command is: wander randomly until a target is detected, approach it, and signal achievement by changing color to red.

    Let me break down the steps:

    1. Wander randomly (using move_randomly)
    2. Check if target is detected (is_target_detected condition)
    3. If target is detected, then:
       a. Approach it: but we don't have an 'approach_target' action in our dictionary. So, perhaps we can use the existing actions to achieve this.
       b. Change color to red (change_color)

    So, after detecting the target, we need to adjust the movement so that the agent moves towards the target.

    However, looking at the available actions, I don't see an 'approach_target' action. The closest is 'flocking', which adjusts movement based on nearby agents, but not directly towards a target.

    Alternatively, perhaps using 'align_with_swarm' could help in moving towards the target if the target is part of the swarm.

    Wait, but the problem is that the agent needs to move towards the target once detected. Since we don't have an action for that, maybe we can create a sequence where after detection, the agent starts moving towards the target using existing actions.

    Alternatively, perhaps 'flocking' could be used in conjunction with other behaviors to achieve approach.

    Hmm, this is tricky.

    Let me think again about the available actions:

    - move_randomly: makes the agent wander randomly
    - change_color: changes color
    - is_target_detected: checks if target is nearby
    - is_obstacle_detected: checks for obstacles
    - avoid_obstacle: avoids obstacles
    - is_agent_in_nest: checks if in nest
    - agent_movement_freeze: freezes movement
    - continue_movement_agent: continues after freeze
    - move_randomly: same as above

    So, the key issue is that we don't have an action to directly approach a target. Therefore, perhaps using 'flocking' or 'align_with_swarm' can help in moving towards the target.

    Alternatively, maybe the agent can use 'flocking' with the target as part of the swarm.

    Wait, but the 'flocking' behavior adjusts the move vector based on nearby agents. If the target is one of the nearby agents, then aligning would make the agent move towards it.

    So perhaps after detecting the target, we can have the agent perform 'align_with_swarm', treating the target as part of the swarm.

    Alternatively, maybe using a combination of 'flocking' and 'align_with_swarm' could help in moving towards the target.

    But I'm not entirely sure how to structure this without an explicit approach action.

    Another thought: perhaps after detecting the target, we can have the agent perform 'move_randomly' but with a bias towards the target. However, since we don't have such an action, maybe it's not possible.

    Alternatively, perhaps using 'flocking' in a way that orients the agent towards the target.

    Wait, perhaps the 'align_with_swarm' can be used to align the agent's movement with nearby agents, including the target. So if the target is within the vicinity, the agent would start moving towards it.

    Therefore, after detecting the target, we can have the agent perform 'align_with_swarm', which would make it move towards the target as part of the swarm.

    Alternatively, perhaps using a combination of 'flocking' and 'align_with_swarm' could help in this case.

    So, putting it all together:

    The behavior tree should first have the agent wander randomly until it detects a target. Then, once detected, it should align with the target (using 'align_with_swarm') to approach it. Finally, upon reaching or getting close enough to the target, change its color to red.

    However, I'm not entirely sure if 'align_with_swarm' can be used in this way without an explicit reference to the target.

    Alternatively, perhaps using a 'Condition' node after detection to execute 'change_color' and then stop wandering",DeepSeek-R1-Distill-llama-8B-Q4_K_M

        </</BehaviorTree>
      </BTCPP_format>

    But wait, the user's command is ""check if path is clear, form a line at the center"". So I need to create a behavior tree that first checks if the path is clear and then forms a line. If the path isn't clear, it should handle accordingly.

    Hmm, perhaps using a Sequence node for the main actions. But what about conditions? Maybe after checking the path, if it's clear, proceed to form the line. Otherwise, maybe fallback to another behavior like moving randomly or stopping.

    Also, I need to make sure that all the nodes used are from the provided dictionary. So 'is_path_clear' is a condition node, and 'form_line' is an action node.

    Wait, in the initial example, there's a Fallback inside the Sequence. Maybe after checking if the path is clear, if it's not, then execute another behavior. But what should that fallback do? Perhaps move randomly or stop.

    Also, I need to include all necessary nodes and ensure the structure is correct. Let me think about how the behavior tree should flow: first check if the path is clear, if yes, form a line; if not, maybe try moving randomly or something else.

    So in XML terms, I'll have a Sequence with two actions: 'is_path_clear' as a condition, then 'form_line'. But since conditions can have fallbacks, perhaps after checking, if it's not clear, execute another action like 'move_randomly'.

    Wait, but the user's command is to first check and then form. So maybe the sequence should be:

    - Check path clear
    - If yes: form line
    - Else: do something else (fallback)

    But in the initial example, the fallback was under a Condition node. Maybe I need to structure it differently.

    Alternatively, perhaps using a Fallback within the Sequence so that if 'is_path_clear' returns FAILURE, then execute another action.

    So the structure would be:

    <Sequence>
      <Action name=""is_path_clear"" />
      <Fallback>
        <Condition name=""is_target_detected"">
          <Action name=""move_randomly"" />
        </</Fallback>
      </</Sequence>

    But wait, that might not cover all cases. Maybe after 'is_path_clear' fails, we need to do something else.

    Alternatively, perhaps the fallback should be another Condition node checking for something else, but I'm not sure what other conditions are available.

    Wait, in the provided behaviors, there's also 'agent_movement_freeze', 'continue_movement_agent', etc. Maybe if path is clear, form line; else, freeze movement or continue as needed.

    But the user's command specifically mentions ""check if path is clear, form a line at the center"". So perhaps the main actions are:

    1. Check if path is clear.
    2. If yes, form a line.
    3. Else, do something else (like move randomly or stop).

    So in terms of behavior tree structure, it's a sequence where after checking, we either proceed to form the line or fallback.

    Therefore, the XML would have a Sequence with 'is_path_clear' as the first step, then if that succeeds, execute 'form_line', else, perhaps execute another action like 'move_randomly'.

    But in the initial example, the Fallback was under the Condition. Maybe I need to structure it so that after checking, if it's not clear, we do something.

    Alternatively, maybe using a Parallel node or other structures, but since the user's command is straightforward, perhaps a simple Sequence suffices.

    So putting it all together:

    But wait, this might not fully capture the user's intent. The user wants to check if the path is clear and then form a line at the center. So perhaps after checking, regardless of the result, we should proceed to form the line.

    Or maybe it's intended that if the path isn't clear, we do something else, like avoid obstacles or move randomly.

    </s>

Okay, so I need to generate a behavior tree for the command ""find the goal, signal success by changing color to red, and align movement with other swarm agents."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, the command has three main parts: finding the goal, signaling success by changing color, and aligning movement with the swarm. I should structure the behavior tree to handle these in sequence.

Starting with finding the goal, I remember that there's an action called FindGoalAction which probably handles searching for the target or goal location. So I'll start the sequence with this action.

Next, after the goal is found, the agent needs to signal success by changing its color to red. The ChangeColorAction can be used here, taking 'red' as the argument. But I should wrap this in a Fallback so that if something goes wrong, like if the goal isn't found, it doesn't crash. So after FindGoalAction, I'll add a Fallback that checks if the goal was successfully found using IsGoalFoundCondition. If it's true, then execute ChangeColorAction with 'red'.

But wait, what if changing color fails? Maybe I should have another fallback for that. However, according to the provided behaviors, all actions return SUCCESS, so maybe it's not necessary. But to be safe, perhaps adding a Fallback after the color change in case something unexpected happens.

Then, aligning movement with other swarm agents. The AlignWithSwarmAction seems appropriate here. This action adjusts the agent's move vector based on nearby agents' movements, which should help in forming a line or following the group.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the sequence to first find the goal, then change color upon success, and then align movement. Each of these actions will be within their own Fallbacks where necessary to ensure the tree doesn't fail if one part doesn't work.

I also need to make sure that each node is correctly named and referenced. The Sequence starts with FindGoalAction, followed by a Fallback that checks if the goal was found before proceeding to change color. Then another Fallback after changing color in case alignment fails or something else goes wrong.

Wait, but in the initial example provided, the structure had nested Fallbacks within Conditions. So I should replicate that structure here. After FindGoalAction, there's a Condition checking if the goal was found. If yes, proceed to change color; otherwise, maybe do nothing? Or perhaps another action. But since the command is to signal success only after finding the goal, it makes sense.

So the sequence would be: FindGoal -> (if found) ChangeColor -> AlignWithSwarm. Each step has its own checks and fallbacks to ensure smooth operation.

I think that's a solid structure. Now, I'll translate this into XML, making sure all elements are correctly nested and named as per the provided dictionary of behaviors.

    However, the user's command is to ""detect target, freeze movement upon reaching it"". So, perhaps a more accurate behavior tree would involve first detecting the target, then moving towards it, and upon reaching, freezing. But in the provided example, the user has a different structure.

    Let me think about how to model this correctly. The correct sequence should be:

    1. Detect if the target is present.
    2. If detected, move towards the target.
    3. Once the agent reaches the target (within 15 units), freeze movement.

    So, in terms of behavior tree structure, we need a sequence that first checks for the target's presence, then executes movement towards it, and upon reaching, freezes.

    However, looking at the provided example, the user has a Sequence with two Conditions: is_target_detected and is_target_reached. The problem here is that if the agent hasn't detected the target yet, it won't proceed to check for reaching. So perhaps the structure should be adjusted to first detect the target, then move towards it, and upon reaching, freeze.

    But in the provided example, the user has a different setup where both Conditions are within the same Sequence, which might not correctly model the intended behavior.

    Therefore, perhaps a better approach is to use a Fallback structure. The idea would be:

    - First, attempt to detect the target.
    - If detected, proceed to move towards it and then freeze upon reaching.
    - If not detected, fallback to another behavior, such as moving randomly or staying in place.

    However, since the user's command is specifically about detecting the target and freezing movement upon reaching it, perhaps a more straightforward Sequence would suffice if we structure it correctly.

    Let me outline the steps again:

    1. Check if the target is detected.
       - If yes: proceed to move towards the target.
       - Then, check if the agent has reached the target.
         - If yes: freeze movement.
         - Else: continue moving towards the target.

    But in the current setup, the user's example doesn't include moving towards the target; it only checks for detection and then freezing. This might not be sufficient because without moving towards the target, the agent won't reach it.

    Therefore, perhaps a more accurate behavior tree would involve:

    - A Sequence that first detects the target.
    - If detected, execute an action to move towards the target.
    - Then, check if the target is reached.
      - If yes: freeze movement.
      - Else: continue moving.

    However, in the provided dictionary of behaviors, there's no specific 'move towards target' action. The available actions include 'flocking', 'align_with_swarm', 'move_randomly', etc., but not a direct 'move_towards_target'.

    This presents a challenge because without an explicit 'move towards target' action, we need to simulate this behavior using existing actions.

    One approach could be to use the 'align_with_swarm' or 'flocking' behaviors to guide the agent towards the target. However, these are more about group behavior rather than direct movement towards a specific point.

    Alternatively, perhaps combining multiple conditions and actions can approximate moving towards the target.

    Another consideration is that the 'is_target_reached' condition checks if the agent is within 15 units of the target. So, once the agent is close enough, it should freeze its movement.

    Given these constraints, let's try to model the behavior tree step by step:

    1. First, check if the target is detected (is_target_detected).
       - If not detected: perhaps do nothing or fallback to another behavior.
       - If detected: proceed.

    2. Once the target is detected, the agent needs to move towards it. Since there's no explicit 'move_towards_target' action, we might need to use existing actions that can achieve this.

    Looking at the available actions:

    - 'flocking': Adjusts the agent's movement based on nearby agents, which could help in moving towards the target if the group is aligned.
    - 'align_with_swarm': Aligns the agent's movement with the average of nearby agents, which might also contribute to moving towards the target.

    However, without a direct action to move towards the target, it's unclear how to implement this. Perhaps using 'flocking' or 'align_with_swarm' in conjunction with other conditions can approximate the",DeepSeek-R1-Distill-llama-8B-Q4_K_M

Okay, so I need to generate a behavior tree in XML format based on the user's command. The command is ""detect an obstacle, avoid it, and then flock safely with other agents."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should identify the required behaviors from the provided dictionary. The user mentioned detecting an obstacle, avoiding it, and flocking. Looking at the dictionary:

- is_obstacle_detected: Condition node to check for obstacles.
- avoid_obstacle: Action node to execute avoidance.
- align_with_swarm: Action node to align with a swarm.
- flocking: Action node to adjust movement based on nearby agents.

So, the behavior tree needs to handle these steps in order. The structure should probably have a sequence where each step is executed one after another.

I'll start by creating a root element with BTCPP_format and main_tree_to_execute attributes. Then, inside the BehaviorTree, there's a Selector for high-level decisions. Within that, I need a Fallback because if obstacle avoidance fails, it should fall back to flocking.

Wait, but in this case, the command is straightforward: detect, avoid, then flock. So maybe instead of a Fallback, it's more like a sequence where each action is executed in order. However, if there's an error in detecting or avoiding, perhaps a Fallback makes sense to prevent getting stuck.

So, the structure would be:

- Selector with name ""ObstacleAvoidance""
  - Fallback named ""ObstacleAvoidanceFallback""
    - Sequence for detection and avoidance
      - is_obstacle_detected
      - avoid_obstacle
    - Then another sequence for flocking if the first fails?
Wait, no. The user's command is to do all three steps: detect, avoid, then flock. So perhaps it's a sequence where each step must succeed.

But in behavior trees, if any condition fails, the tree should handle it gracefully. So maybe using a Fallback after the main sequence for obstacle avoidance, which then proceeds to flocking.

Alternatively, since the user wants all three steps, I can structure it as a sequence within a Selector, with each step being a separate node.

Wait, perhaps the high-level decision is to execute the ObstacleAvoidanceFallback. Inside that, there's a Sequence for detection and avoidance, and if that succeeds, then another action to flock. But how to represent that in XML?

Hmm, maybe using a Fallback isn't necessary here because all steps are dependent on each other. So perhaps it's better to structure it as a single sequence where each step is executed in order.

So the BehaviorTree would have a Selector with a Sequence containing:

1. is_obstacle_detected
2. avoid_obstacle
3. flocking

But wait, after avoiding an obstacle, does the agent automatically flock? Or should there be a separate condition for that?

Alternatively, maybe after successfully avoiding the obstacle, the agent should proceed to flock regardless of any other conditions.

So in XML terms:

<BehaviorTree ID=""ObstacleAvoidance"">
  <Selector name=""High-Level Decision"">
    <Sequence name=""ObstacleAvoidanceSequence"">
      <is_obstacle_detected/>
      <avoid_obstacle/>
      <flocking/>
    </Sequence>
  </Selector>
</BehaviorTree>

But then, what if is_obstacle_detected returns FAILURE? The sequence would stop at that point. So the agent wouldn't attempt to flock in that case.

Wait, but the user's command says ""detect an obstacle, avoid it, and then flock safely."" So perhaps all three steps should be attempted only if detection and avoidance are successful.

So the structure is correct as a Sequence where each step depends on the previous one's success.

Additionally, I need to include all nodes in the TreeNodesModel. That includes the Condition for obstacle detection and the two Action nodes for avoiding obstacles and flocking.

Putting it all together, the XML should have:

- root element with attributes
- BehaviorTree with ID
