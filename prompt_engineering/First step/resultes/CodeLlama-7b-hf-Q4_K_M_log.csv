Args: message (str): The message to be spoken. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed.
flocking: Action Node: Adjust the agent's move vector by blending alignment and separation forces from nearby agents. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed.
align_with_swarm: Action Node: Align the agent's move vector with the average movement of nearby agents. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed.
is_obstacle_detected: Condition node: Determine if any obstacles are detected in the vicinity of the agent. Returns: SUCCESS if an obstacle is detected, FAILURE otherwise.
avoid_obstacle: Action node: Execute an action to avoid detected obstacles. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed.
is_target_detected: Condition node: Check if the target is within a detectable distance from the agent's position. Returns: SUCCESS if the target is within 20 units of distance, FAILURE otherwise.
is_target_reached: Condition node: Check if the agent has reached the target. Returns: SUCCESS if the target is within 15 units of distance, FAILURE otherwise.

continue_movement_agent: Action node: Continue the agent's movement after it has been previously frozen. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed.
move_randomly: Action node: Perform a wandering action where the agent moves randomly within the environment. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed.
is_path_clear: Condition node: Check if the path ahead of the agent is clear of obstacles. Returns: SUCCESS if no obstacles are detected ahead, FAILURE if obstacles are present.
is_line_formed: Condition node: Determine if the agent has formed a line with a reference point at the center of the window. Returns: SUCCESS if the line is formed with the center, FAILURE otherwise.
form_line: Action node: Direct the agent to form a line towards the center of the window. This function adjuststhe agent's position to align it with the center.
