Args: message (str): The message to be spoken. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed.
flocking: Action Node: Adjust the agent's move vector by blending alignment and separation forces from nearby agents. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed.

    The provided instructions are clear and concise, but they do not include the specific XML structure for the behavior tree. However, based on the given command ""find the goal, signal success by changing color to red, and align movement with other swarm agents"", we can infer that the desired behavior tree should have a root element with BTCPP_format and main_tree_to_execute attributes. The inner structure of the <BehaviorTree> element should include Sequences, Fallback, Conditions, and Actions. 
    The <TreeNodesModel> section should list all node models used in the behavior tree. 
    No additional text or commentary outside the XML is allowed. 
    The output should follow this XML structure exactly. 
    Here's an example of how to construct a behavior tree for the given command:
    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
    <BTCPP_format xmlns=""http://www.behaviortree.org/schema/v4"">
        <main_tree_to_execute>
            <Sequence>
                <Condition name=""is_goal_detected"">
                    <is_path_clear />
                </Condition>
                <Action name=""change_color"" args=""red"" />
                <Fallback name=""align_with_swarm"" />
            </Sequence>
        </main_tree_to_execute>
    </BTCPP_format>
    This XML structure meets the requirements and can be used to execute the desired behavior tree. 
    The <BehaviorTree> element has a Sequence inner structure, which includes a Condition node named ""is_goal_detected"" that checks if the path ahead of the agent is clear using the <is_path_clear> action node. If the condition is true, the <Action name=""change_color"" args=""red""> action node changes the agent's color to red. If the condition is false, the <Fallback name=""align_with_swarm""> action node aligns the agent's movement with other swarm agents using the <align_with_swarm> action node. 
    The <TreeNodesModel> section lists all node models used in the behavior tree: say, Action Node: Speak the provided message using text-to-speech if it hasn't been spoken before. Args: message (str): The message to be spoken. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed. flocking: Action Node: Adjust the agent's move vector by blending alignment and separation forces from nearby agents. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed. align_with_swarm: Action Node: Align the agent's move vector with the average movement of nearby agents. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed. is_obstacle_detected: Condition node: Determine if any obstacles are detected in the vicinity of the agent. Returns: SUCCESS if an obstacle is detected, FAILURE otherwise. avoid_obstacle: Action node: Execute an action to avoid detected obstacles. Returns: Always returns SUCCESS, indicating the action was executed. is_target_detected: Condition node: Check if the target is within a detectable distance from the agent's position. Returns: SUCCESS if the target is within 20 units of distance, FAILURE otherwise. is_target_reached: Condition node: Check if the agent has reached the target. Returns: SUCCESS if the target is within 15 units of distance, FAILURE otherwise. change_color: Action Node: Change the agent's color to 'white', 'green', or 'red'.
