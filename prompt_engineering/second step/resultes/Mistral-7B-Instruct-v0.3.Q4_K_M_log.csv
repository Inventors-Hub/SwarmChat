In this XML structure, I have created a behavior tree with a Sequence node as the root. Inside the root Sequence node, there are three nested Sequence nodes representing the different paths that the robot can take based on the battery level. The first Sequence node checks if the battery is low and, if so, navigates back to the base and charges the battery. If the battery is not low, it continues with the current task. During the execution of the task, another check is performed to see if the battery level drops below the threshold, in which case a notification is sent to the operator.
